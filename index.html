  <h1>Tubal Ligation</h1>
  <p>This should be one of the most common operations you do and many women and couples will be very grateful for it. Choose it after careful consideration of the alternatives (a copper IUD is good for 8yrs and nearly as effective, a hormone IUD is good for 5yrs and at least as effective but expensive), so your operation must be as safe and as painless as it can be. Try not to keep a mother waiting long for surgery, or she may become pregnant meanwhile!</p>
  <p>Large numbers of mothers would like their tubes tied, and if you take the trouble to encourage them, many will be willing to accept it. But however many ligations you do, you will probably be only able to satisfy a small fraction of the community's need.</p>
  <p>You can:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Tie a woman's tubes at the same time that you perform a Caesarean Section</li>
    <li>Perform a 'mini-laparotomy', which is a laparotomy through a very small incision.</li>
    <li>Occlude the tubes through a laparoscope.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Tying the tubes immediately after delivery (and to some extent after a miscarriage) has several advantages:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>They are easier to access when the uterus is still enlarged.</li>
    <li>The patient will already be in hospital, whereas if you discharge her and ask her to come back, she may never return.</li>
    <li>Immediately after a normal delivery/miscarriage she will tolerate the minimal additional trauma of sterilization particularly well. </li>
    <li>If you have already opened the abdomen for some other reason, including Caesarean Section (or perforation after a backstreet abortion), tying the tubes is easy. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>There are, however, some minor disadvantages in doing it at this time: (a) She may change her mind later, though in practice this is rare. (b) You may have not been able to exclude a serious abnormality in the newborn beforehand. </p>
